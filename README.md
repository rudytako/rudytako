Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Maciej and I come from Poland. I've been coding for five years and currently I'am studying IT in Warsaw.<br />
I'm a software developer with an experience in working on several projects.<br />
In each project I was a part of a team consisting of about 10 people.<br />
I code in Java and Typescript, especially with the MERN stack.<br />
<br />
Now I am developing my devOps skills.<br />

<br />

In my free time I love to read books about psychology.<br />
I am also interested in law and politics.</br></br>
